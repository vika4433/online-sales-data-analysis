# **Project Scope: Interactive Data Analysis Application**

## **1. Project Overview**
This project aims to develop an interactive data analysis application using **Windsurf IDE**. The application will leverage Python libraries such as **Pandas, NumPy, and Streamlit** for dynamic data processing and visualization.

## **2. Objectives**
- Develop a functional interactive application for data analysis.
- Implement data preprocessing techniques for cleaning and transforming raw datasets.
- Integrate statistical computations and visual analytics.
- Enable interactive user-driven data exploration through **Streamlit**.
- Ensure a well-documented, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

## **3. Features & Functionalities**

### **3.1 Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**
- Dynamically load CSV datasets.
- Handle missing values through **mean/median imputation**.
- Detect and remove outliers.
- Convert data types appropriately.

### **3.2 Statistical Analysis**
- Compute fundamental statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, variance).
- Correlation analysis between variables.
- Use **NumPy** for mathematical transformations.

### **3.3 Data Visualization**
- Display processed data in a structured tabular format.
- Generate interactive charts (trend analysis, distribution plots, etc.).
- Provide real-time filtering and variable selection.

### **3.4 Interactive UI with Streamlit**
- Create a dynamic user interface for seamless interaction.
- Allow users to adjust parameters and visualize updated results.
- Enable CSV export of processed data.
- Provide users with the option to download processed data as a new CSV file.

### **3.5 Code Quality & Documentation**
- Follow **PEP8** coding standards.
- Document each function and module with clear explanations.
- Maintain structured project organization.

## **4. Tools & Technologies**
- **IDE**: Windsurf IDE
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Version Control**: Git (for tracking changes and collaboration)

## **5. Deliverables**
- Fully functional **Windsurf IDE-based interactive application**.
- Processed dataset with statistical insights.
- User-friendly UI for data visualization and exploration.
- Well-documented code and a final project report.

## **6. Assumptions & Constraints**
- The application is designed for structured CSV datasets.
- Users should have basic familiarity with data analysis concepts.
- Performance optimization will be limited to handling mid-sized datasets.

## **7. Risks & Mitigation Strategy**
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Large datasets causing performance issues | Optimize data loading and limit UI interactions with large files |
| Missing or inconsistent data | Implement robust data validation and preprocessing techniques |
| UI usability concerns | Conduct iterative testing and refine the user experience |

## **8. Future Enhancements**
- Support for multiple file formats (Excel, JSON).
- Integration with external databases.
- Advanced machine learning-based insights.
